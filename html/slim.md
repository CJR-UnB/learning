# Slim

### O que Ã© Slim e qual sua utilidade?

Slim is a template language whose goal is reduce the syntax to the essential parts without becoming cryptic.

Slim is a fast, lightweight templating engine with support for Rails 3 and 4. It has been heavily tested on all major ruby implementations. We use continuous integration (travis-ci).

Slim's core syntax is guided by one thought: "What's the minimum required to make this work".

As more people have contributed to Slim, there have been syntax additions influenced from their use of Haml and Jade. The Slim team is open to these additions because we know beauty is in the eye of the beholder.

Slim allows you to write very minimal templates which are easy to maintain and pretty much guarantees that you write well-formed HTML and XML

We also think that the Slim syntax is also aesthetic and makes it much more fun to write templates. Since you can use Slim as a drop-in replacement in all the major framework you can start easily.

The Slim architecture is very flexible and allows you to write syntax extensions and plugins.
